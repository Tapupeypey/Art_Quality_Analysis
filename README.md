# Art_Quality_Analysis
I will be exploring the global air quality (Dec 2023-Dec 2024) dataset from Kaggle.  This dataset focuses on CO, CO2, NO2, SO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10 levels in six major cities, along with its Air Quality Index (AQI).  I will be focusing my analysis on the AQI, thinking about the linear relationship between these air pollutants and rising AQI.
